Hello World.

"I googled but all I get is old information, I only want to look up information that is less than 3 years old."
"I want to search only English articles."
I made a Chrome Extension for such cases.

You can filter Google search results by time (within 3 years, within 1 week, etc.) and language (English, Japanese, etc.) with 1-click.

In the development of Choomame, I'm using GitHub Actions as CI/CD and will update regularly!
You can jump to the Choomame repository from the following link.

Actually, this Chrome Extension is an improved versioin of my previous extension "Amazing Searcher"(2021).
So I will do my best to do better than Amazing Searcher.
