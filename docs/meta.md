Choomame shows the following link to Popup and the Google search results.

- `Time`: restrict results to a specific time period
  - example: 3 years, 1 month, 1 week ...
- `Language`: restrict results to a specific language
  - example: English, Japanese, Spanish ...
- `Custom Link`: easy access to frequently viewed pages, site searches, official documents
  - Check https://github.com/eetann/choomame-custom-link-collection#readme for details.
  - Please operate links at your own risk.

These can be freely customized on the option page.

If you want to use a shortcut key to open a popup, type `Ctrl(Command) + q`. This shortcut key can be assigned freely at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts'.

In Vivaldi, it is not available, so I have added `Alt+Q` to open a tab instead of popup. It might be useful to register it as a web panel.

Choomame is an improved versioin of my previous extension "Amazing Searcher".

## コメント文

Hello World.

"I googled but all I get is old information, I only want to look up information that is less than 3 years old."
"I want to search only English articles."
I made a Chrome Extension for such cases.

You can filter Google search results by time (within 3 years, within 1 week, etc.) and language (English, Japanese, etc.) with 1-click.

In the development of Choomame, I'm using GitHub Actions as CI/CD and will update regularly!
You can jump to the Choomame repository from the following link.

Actually, this Chrome Extension is an improved versioin of my previous extension "Amazing Searcher"(2021).
So I will do my best to do better than Amazing Searcher.
